# Agicap AI Assistant

## Description

We are developing an AI Assistant for Agicap that can answer questions about the company's financial data. The AI Assistant can respond to questions such as:

- What is the company's revenue for January 2023?
- What is the amount of the company's expenses for February 2021?
- Who are my top 5 clients currently?

The AI Assistant will be integrated with Agicap's various APIs to access the necessary data to answer user questions.
